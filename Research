# LULC Prediction (2004 → 2014 → 2024 → 2031)

---

## 🔑 Objective
To predict land use/land cover (LULC) changes for a small town in Bangladesh using a **ConvLSTM deep learning model** with static drivers (DEM, distance-to-road).

## 📈 Key Findings
- Built-up area increased from **4.01% → 10.07%** (2004–2024).  
- Growth concentrated along **road networks**, with decline in vegetation & waterbody.  
- ConvLSTM achieved:  
  - **Overall Accuracy:** 65%  
  - **F1 Score:** 66%  
  - **QADI Index:** 0.17

## ⚙️ Model Architecture (Simplified)
```text
Input: LULC_2004, LULC_2014, Drivers (DEM, Distance-to-road)
   ↓ Patchify (128×128)
   ↓ ConvLSTM (stacked layers)
   ↓ Dense + Softmax
Output: Predicted LULC (2024, 2031)
